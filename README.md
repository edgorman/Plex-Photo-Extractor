# Plex-Photo-Extractor

This repository contains a custom chrome extension for downloading content from a plex media server from the [Plex Website](https://app.plex.tv/desktop). There are popular versions of this app already available however I did not trust their access to personal data, and I've made this available on Github for likeminded people. This app is NOT available on the Chrome Webstore.

## Installation
Use the following command to clone the repository:
```
cd your/repo/directory
git clone https://github.com/edgorman/Plex-Photo-Extractor
```

Go to the [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/) page and enable 'Developer Mode'.

Click the 'Load Unpacked' button and select the cloned folder.

Verify the extension has appeared in your list of extensions.

## Usage
Navigate to the plex content you're trying to download.

Click the new chrome extension (icon should be an uppercase p).

The extension should automatically open the content in a new tab.

Right click and save to your computer.
